    """
    Class to store the mesh rasterization params with defaults

    Members:
        image_size: Either common height and width or (height, width), in pixels.
        blur_radius: Float distance in the range [0, 2] used to expand the face
            bounding boxes for rasterization. Setting blur radius
            results in blurred edges around the shape instead of a
            hard boundary. Set to 0 for no blur.
        faces_per_pixel: (int) Number of faces to keep track of per pixel.
            We return the nearest faces_per_pixel faces along the z-axis.
        bin_size: Size of bins to use for coarse-to-fine rasterization. Setting
            bin_size=0 uses naive rasterization; setting bin_size=None attempts
            to set it heuristically based on the shape of the input. This should
            not affect the output, but can affect the speed of the forward pass.
        max_faces_opengl: Max number of faces in any mesh we will rasterize. Used only by
            MeshRasterizerOpenGL to pre-allocate OpenGL memory.
        max_faces_per_bin: Only applicable when using coarse-to-fine
            rasterization (bin_size != 0); this is the maximum number of faces
            allowed within each bin. This should not affect the output values,
            but can affect the memory usage in the forward pass.
            Setting max_faces_per_bin=None attempts to set with a heuristic.
        perspective_correct: Whether to apply perspective correction when
            computing barycentric coordinates for pixels.
            None (default) means make correction if the camera uses perspective.
        clip_barycentric_coords: Whether, after any perspective correction
            is applied but before the depth is calculated (e.g. for
            z clipping), to "correct" a location outside the face (i.e. with
            a negative barycentric coordinate) to a position on the edge of the
            face. None (default) means clip if blur_radius > 0, which is a condition
            under which such outside-face-points are likely.
        cull_backfaces: Whether to only rasterize mesh faces which are
            visible to the camera.  This assumes that vertices of
            front-facing triangles are ordered in an anti-clockwise
            fashion, and triangles that face away from the camera are
            in a clockwise order relative to the current view
            direction. NOTE: This will only work if the mesh faces are
            consistently defined with counter-clockwise ordering when
            viewed from the outside.
        z_clip_value: if not None, then triangles will be clipped (and possibly
            subdivided into smaller triangles) such that z >= z_clip_value.
            This avoids camera projections that go to infinity as z->0.
            Default is None as clipping affects rasterization speed and
            should only be turned on if explicitly needed.
            See clip.py for all the extra computation that is required.
        cull_to_frustum: Whether to cull triangles outside the view frustum.
            Culling involves removing all faces which fall outside view frustum.
            Default is False for performance as often not needed.

        """
        Rasterize a batch of meshes given the shape of the desired output image.
        Each mesh is rasterized onto a separate image of shape
        (H, W) if `image_size` is a tuple or (image_size, image_size) if it
        is an int.

        If the desired image size is non square (i.e. a tuple of (H, W) where H != W)
        the aspect ratio needs special consideration. There are two aspect ratios
        to be aware of:
            - the aspect ratio of each pixel
            - the aspect ratio of the output image
        The camera can be used to set the pixel aspect ratio. In the rasterizer,
        we assume square pixels, but variable image aspect ratio (i.e rectangle images).

        In most cases you will want to set the camera aspect ratio to
        1.0 (i.e. square pixels) and only vary the
        `image_size` (i.e. the output image dimensions in pixels).

        Args:
            meshes: A Meshes object representing a batch of meshes, batch size N.
            image_size: Size in pixels of the output image to be rasterized.
                Can optionally be a tuple of (H, W) in the case of non square images.
            blur_radius: Float distance in the range [0, 2] used to expand the face
                bounding boxes for rasterization. Setting blur radius
                results in blurred edges around the shape instead of a
                hard boundary. Set to 0 for no blur.
            faces_per_pixel (Optional): Number of faces to save per pixel, returning
                the nearest faces_per_pixel points along the z-axis.
            bin_size: Size of bins to use for coarse-to-fine rasterization. Setting
                bin_size=0 uses naive rasterization; setting bin_size=None attempts to
                set it heuristically based on the shape of the input. This should not
                affect the output, but can affect the speed of the forward pass.
            max_faces_per_bin: Only applicable when using coarse-to-fine rasterization
                (bin_size > 0); this is the maximum number of faces allowed within each
                bin. This should not affect the output values, but can affect
                the memory usage in the forward pass.
            perspective_correct: Bool, Whether to apply perspective correction when computing
                barycentric coordinates for pixels. This should be set to True if a perspective
                camera is used.
            clip_barycentric_coords: Whether, after any perspective correction is applied
                but before the depth is calculated (e.g. for z clipping),
                to "correct" a location outside the face (i.e. with a negative
                barycentric coordinate) to a position on the edge of the face.
            cull_backfaces: Bool, Whether to only rasterize mesh faces which are
                visible to the camera.  This assumes that vertices of
                front-facing triangles are ordered in an anti-clockwise
                fashion, and triangles that face away from the camera are
                in a clockwise order relative to the current view
                direction. NOTE: This will only work if the mesh faces are
                consistently defined with counter-clockwise ordering when
                viewed from the outside.
            z_clip_value: if not None, then triangles will be clipped (and possibly
                subdivided into smaller triangles) such that z >= z_clip_value.
                This avoids camera projections that go to infinity as z->0.
                Default is None as clipping affects rasterization speed and
                should only be turned on if explicitly needed.
                See clip.py for all the extra computation that is required.
            cull_to_frustum: if True, triangles outside the view frustum will be culled.
                Culling involves removing all faces which fall outside view frustum.
                Default is False so that it is turned on only when needed.

        Returns:
            4-element tuple containing

            - **pix_to_face**: LongTensor of shape
            (N, image_size, image_size, faces_per_pixel)
            giving the indices of the nearest faces at each pixel,
            sorted in ascending z-order.
            Concretely ``pix_to_face[n, y, x, k] = f`` means that
            ``faces_verts[f]`` is the kth closest face (in the z-direction)
            to pixel (y, x). Pixels that are hit by fewer than
            faces_per_pixel are padded with -1.
            - **zbuf**: FloatTensor of shape (N, image_size, image_size, faces_per_pixel)
            giving the NDC z-coordinates of the nearest faces at each pixel,
            sorted in ascending z-order.
            Concretely, if ``pix_to_face[n, y, x, k] = f`` then
            ``zbuf[n, y, x, k] = face_verts[f, 2]``. Pixels hit by fewer than
            faces_per_pixel are padded with -1.
            - **barycentric**: FloatTensor of shape
            (N, image_size, image_size, faces_per_pixel, 3)
            giving the barycentric coordinates in NDC units of the
            nearest faces at each pixel, sorted in ascending z-order.
            Concretely, if ``pix_to_face[n, y, x, k] = f`` then
            ``[w0, w1, w2] = barycentric[n, y, x, k]`` gives
            the barycentric coords for pixel (y, x) relative to the face
            defined by ``face_verts[f]``. Pixels hit by fewer than
            faces_per_pixel are padded with -1.
            - **pix_dists**: FloatTensor of shape
            (N, image_size, image_size, faces_per_pixel)
            giving the signed Euclidean distance (in NDC units) in the
            x/y plane of each point closest to the pixel. Concretely if
            ``pix_to_face[n, y, x, k] = f`` then ``pix_dists[n, y, x, k]`` is the
            squared distance between the pixel (y, x) and the face given
            by vertices ``face_verts[f]``. Pixels hit with fewer than
            ``faces_per_pixel`` are padded with -1.

            In the case that image_size is a tuple of (H, W) then the outputs
            will be of shape `(N, H, W, ...)`.
